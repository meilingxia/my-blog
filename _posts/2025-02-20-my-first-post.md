I have been learning **Cybersecurity** on TryHackMe since November 2024, with the goal of becoming a **Cybersecurity Penetration Tester**. 
I started with *Cyber Security 101*, a course designed for beginners. 
I am nearly finished and would like to summarize what I have learned, with the goal of sharing this knowledge with individuals who have little to no background in computer science or cybersecurity.
I will write it mainly in English, and some will be translated into Chinese, with translations provided by ChatGPT.

我从2024年11月开始在TryHackMe学习网络安全知识，目标是成为一名网络安全渗透测试员。  
我从Cyber Security 101课程开始，这是一个为初学者设计的课程。我快完成了这门课程，并希望总结我所学的内容，目标是将这些知识分享给那些几乎没有计算机科学或网络安全背景的人。  
主要用英语写，有些将通过ChatGPT翻译成中文。
