# first blog
*The content of this blog is based on my learning experience on TryHackMe. I am a paid member and use ChatGPT to help me understand the relevant knowledge. All articles are based on my personal study summaries and are not direct copies of TryHackMe's official content. Instead, they reflect my understanding and organization of the courses, aiming to help others who are interested in cybersecurity but lack a foundational background.*

I have been learning **Cybersecurity** on TryHackMe since November 2024, with the goal of becoming a **Cybersecurity Penetration Tester**. 

I started with *Cyber Security 101*, a course designed for beginners. I am nearly finished and would like to summarize what I have learned, with the goal of sharing this knowledge with individuals who have little to no background in computer science or cybersecurity.

*本博客的内容来源于我在 TryHackMe 上的学习经验，我是其付费会员，并使用 ChatGPT 来帮助理解相关知识。所有文章均基于我个人的学习总结，并非直接复制 TryHackMe 的官方内容，而是我对课程的理解和整理，旨在帮助其他对网络安全感兴趣但缺乏基础的人。*

我从2024年11月开始在TryHackMe学习网络安全知识，目标是成为一名网络安全渗透测试员。  
我从Cyber Security 101课程开始，这是一个为初学者设计的课程。我快完成了这门课程，并希望总结我所学的内容，目标是将这些知识分享给那些几乎没有计算机科学或网络安全背景的人。
