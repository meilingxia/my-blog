## How data is transmit in Physical Layer
Assuming devices are connected via network cables, ***electrical signals*** transmit data in binary (***1*** and ***0***) over the cables.
#### What is Electrical Signals
It refers to voltage changes or current changes, which represents binary data (1 and 0) and enables digital communication.
#### Binary Representation
1. Computers and digital devices can only understand binary (***1*** and ***0***).
2. These binary bits (bit) are represented using electrical signals.
#### How Do Electrical Signals Represent ***1*** and ***0***
1. ***High voltage*** (e.g., +5V) → Represents binary "***1***"
2. ***Low voltage***  (e.g., 0V)  → Represents binary "***0***"

#### Wireless transmit
1. Wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth): Use radio waves to represent binary data.
2. In 5G networks, communication between the base station and your phone is still fundamentally binary (***1*** and ***0***) transmission, but the form of the signal is different.
 
## The Data Link Layer
1. Network Interface Card (***NIC***) <--->***MAC*** address.

## Network Layer
The third layer of the OSI model (Network Layer) is where routing and data reassembly take place, assembling small chunks of data into a larger whole.
1. Routing 
2. Communication via ***IP*** Addresses
3. data assembling

## Transport Layer
1. TCP
2. UDP

## Session Layer
1. session
2. checkpoint

## Presentation Layer
1. translation
2. formatting
3. Encryption & Security
